7,286025,Victor Falls,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/victor-falls/,8.0,"From the parking area, pedal away from 198th Avenue, up a dirt road known as the Main Access Road. At 0.2 miles, pass around a gate. Almost immediately, reach a 4-way and turn left onto a wide trail known as Elevator. Right away it narrows and ascends steeply. Stay on the main trail as you climb, ignoring two trails on the right. The trail crests and seems to end at a dirt road, 0.8 mile. Across the road on the right, though, the trail continues. From here, the trail, known as Route 66, winds then drops. Pass straight through a 4-way at 1.0 mile. At 1.2 miles, reach a T and turn left. At 1.4 miles, reach another T and turn right. Descend and then wind around a swale of low brush that contains the hulk of a white truck. Arrive at a T at 1.8 miles, and turn left. The trail ends at 198th Avenue at 1.9 miles - turn right and ride alongside the paved road. 

At 2.1 miles, find a singletrack that exits the road on the right and take it. The trail winds and twists. Ride straight through a 4-way at 2.4 miles. When the trail divides, 2.7 miles, stay to the right. Pedal straight through another 4-way at 2.9 miles. Reach a gravel road at 3.2 miles - hop on the slightly technical singletrack that continues on the opposite side. When the trail forks, bear right. Reach a T at a narrow road, 3.3 miles, and go right, descending. At 3.6 miles, reach a T and turn right. The narrow road forks at 3.7 miles - bear left. At 3.8 miles, immediately before reaching a T, turn right on a singletrack. Whoa - this is an easy turn to miss. 

The trail, narrow and winding, heads north and is at times brushy and overgrown, as blackberry vines lunge at unprotected skin and spiders, web and all, catch rides on the first bike through. After some good pedaling unmolested by a dividing trail, you\'ll reach a wide dirt road, 4.3 miles. The singletrack begins again on the opposite side of the road after a short jog to the right. At 4.4 miles, ride straight through a 4-way. Stay on the main trail, known as Mustang, as it sweeps back and forth, in and out of the trees, then finally out again. Ignore a trail back on the right at 5.5 miles. Just beyond, the trail splits again and this time bear right.

From here, still out in the open of a clearcut, the singletrack gradually widens. Reach a 4-way of dirt roads at 5.7 miles and proceed straight ahead. At 5.9 miles, arrive at a complicated 4-way intersection at a major gravel road - turn right onto the wide gravel road, ignoring the lesser cut-off road immediately prior on your right. Ride toward a conspicuous stand of trees about one quarter-mile ahead. When the road forks at 6.0 miles, bear right. Ignore a lesser road on the left at 6.1 miles. Bear left at the fork at 6.2 miles. Just when you\'ve had enough of the road riding, find a singletrack on the right, 6.4 miles, that enters that conspicuous stand of trees. This trail is called Cut Your Bars, although after years of use it\'s not quite that technical anymore. 

At 6.7 miles, the trail pops out at a 4-way (three roads, plus your trail). Turn right on the road. When the road forks at 6.9 miles, go left on a narrow dirt road. Ignore a tasty looking singletrack on the right at 7.0 miles. But at 7.1 miles, find another singletrack and turn right. This small area, often referred to as Snickers, bound by the narrow road behind and the Access Road ahead, contains a maze of fun, zippy trails - and a few tours through the maze are well worth your while. At 7.2 miles, reach a fork and bear left. At 7.3 miles, reach a fork and go right. Bear right again at the next fork, then drop down to reach Access Road at 7.5 miles, then turn left. When you arrive at the 4-way, 7.6 miles, you\'ve connected the loop. Go straight through the 4-way, around the gate, and glide back to the parking area at the Christmas tree farm, 7.8 miles. 

Directions: From Bellevue, take Interstate 405 south to Exit 2 in Tukwila. Then head south on Highway 167 toward Puyallup. Take the Highway 410 Exit toward Yakima, and drive east just over 5.5 miles to Bonney Lake. Turn right on South Prairie Road E., and set your odometer to zero. At 1.5 miles, turn right on 214th Avenue E. At 2.4 miles, turn right on 120th Street E. Reach a T at 3.2 miles, and turn left onto 198th Avenue E. At 3.7 miles, find Hillside Farms Christmas Trees on the right. Show some mountain bike courtesy: Don\'t litter or relieve yourself in the parking lot.

"," The huge parcel of land south of Highway 410, bounded by the Puyallup River to the west, the Carbon River to the south, and 198th Avenue E. to the east, commonly known as Victor Falls, is one of the premier mountain bike spots in the south Puget Sound region, and it's all private property.   
A phenomenal number of trails and dirt roads, ranging from easy to technical, crisscross the site, making for excellent exploring. If you want to get lost, this is the place to ride. This loop functions as an excellent introduction to Victor Falls. If you can find it, check out Jim Hendricks' map of the area, which remains remarkably accurate despite logging and some blocks of new houses. Of course more new houses are slated for this area, and logging (in advance of development) may obliterate or re-route even more trails. So be prepared for changes. It must be noted that for years our heroes at Hillside Farms Christmas Trees have allowed mountain bikers to park in the lot from January through the end of October. Don't trash the parking area! Please respect the closure dates so they can sell trees - and they'd sure like it if you bought your Christmas tree there. It should also be noted that the landowner tolerates non-motorized use; be a good citizen out on the trails so we can keep it that way.

With many miles of mountain biking trails spanning a wide variety of skill levels and physical challenge - including a bona fide double-diamond DH trail and killer views of Mount Rainier from the summit - Tiger Mountain is one of Seattle's most popular mountain biking destinations.

All trails are open year round, but during the winter months or after significant weather events, the trails are subject to closures: check for updates on this page and on the DNR's Tiger Mountain page here.

There are also many miles of logging roads that are open all year long, but these too may be closed (typically for timber harvest).  Check the DNR link above.

You can get lost in Fox Park quite easily (I do all the time), so give yourself a big window of time.  Also, please don't pay too much attention to the trail length I gave.  I honestly can't tell you how far back this goes.  <br />
<br />
This place has a good bit of variety, but it is mostly rocky/root-y single track that you'll be crawling up or flying down.  There are some features mixed into the trails.  A large 15+ foot log with the top hacked flat crosses a stream, a rather arbitrary boardwalk which reaches about 10 feet tall x 30 feet long you can ride down through the pine trees, and a dirt jump section which includes a few smaller jumps, an inclined log, some random log I think you're supposed to hop onto, and the coolest thing, a 3 foot high jump which throws you onto a steep decline at the bottom of which begins a 20 foot boardwalk/ramp that ends with a 6 - 7 foot gap.  I ate dirt my first and only time, and my shin's still numb from where I banged it on the ground.  So, Fox Park definitely has some cool stuff and it needs to really be explored!  A lot of stream crossings could be cause for some more bridges, because I find myself walking across more than riding through.<br />
<br />
The best strategy, I think, is to climb to the highest point you can, which inevitably leads to the dirt jump section ... maybe.  Honestly, someone needs to map that place.  It's also a place where some swamp walks could be a huuuuuuuuuuge benefit.  Anybody looking to develop a trail, check out Fox Park!","From I-93 North or South, take exit 25 and turn right.  Once you hit the traffic circle, take the third exit and drive through town.  The road will fork right after the post office, and so you want to continue right.  Watch out for college students and pedestrians!  Go up the hill, past the bank, and take a left at the blinking yellow light onto Langdon St.  Continue through a four-way stop, and you want to take a right following the funeral home.

In the middle of the bowl, if you take a left, you'll hit some of the fastest single track in the Gyro, which has wider turns, is mostly flat, and with some nice dips here and there.  Also a  long 2 x 4 that clears a gap you can skip if you're not comfortable with it.  Follow the track and it will come out close to the river (this is also where one of the other trails connects, so be on the lookout for other bikers).  Take the track along the lake and continue on (you'll see some smaller dirt jumps), ride over the see-saw, and you'll be out of the system and amidst some small houses.  You're back out on the road.  Take a right, and you can go back to the gas station.<br />
<br />
The second trailhead on the right begins the twistier single track where you'll have to watch your handlebars and weasel through some tighter spots.  This track is the longest, goes all over the place, comes out close to the river, but then turns back into the woods.  The trail will pass through a clearing and end up where that first trail comes out.  You can either continue on toward the river and finish out on the road, or you can turn on the faster single track and end your trip with the dirt bowl and come back out on the dirt service road. The trail on the left is not very twisty, it's quite short (fun too), and will pass by an impressive BMX/DJ section, before coming out in the parking lot of the first gas station you had earlier passed.  Try to turn it all into a big loop! <br />
<br />
Optional: If you want, keep taking that dirt service road back, go over an old bridge with holes in it, and into a field.  Best in the springtime when the grass is lower, but still very Little House on the Prairie any time of year.  If you see ATV/bike tracks, follow them and watch out for animal dwellings.

Get on your bike, get back to the main road, and cross over to the gas station.  Take a left, see the service road between the two gas stations, and get on it.

7,286025,Victor Falls,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/victor-falls/,8.0,"From the parking area, pedal away from 198th Avenue, up a dirt road known as the Main Access Road. At 0.2 miles, pass around a gate. Almost immediately, reach a 4-way and turn left onto a wide trail known as Elevator. Right away it narrows and ascends steeply. Stay on the main trail as you climb, ignoring two trails on the right. The trail crests and seems to end at a dirt road, 0.8 mile. Across the road on the right, though, the trail continues. From here, the trail, known as Route 66, winds then drops. Pass straight through a 4-way at 1.0 mile. At 1.2 miles, reach a T and turn left. At 1.4 miles, reach another T and turn right. Descend and then wind around a swale of low brush that contains the hulk of a white truck. Arrive at a T at 1.8 miles, and turn left. The trail ends at 198th Avenue at 1.9 miles - turn right and ride alongside the paved road. 

At 2.1 miles, find a singletrack that exits the road on the right and take it. The trail winds and twists. Ride straight through a 4-way at 2.4 miles. When the trail divides, 2.7 miles, stay to the right. Pedal straight through another 4-way at 2.9 miles. Reach a gravel road at 3.2 miles - hop on the slightly technical singletrack that continues on the opposite side. When the trail forks, bear right. Reach a T at a narrow road, 3.3 miles, and go right, descending. At 3.6 miles, reach a T and turn right. The narrow road forks at 3.7 miles - bear left. At 3.8 miles, immediately before reaching a T, turn right on a singletrack. Whoa - this is an easy turn to miss. 

The trail, narrow and winding, heads north and is at times brushy and overgrown, as blackberry vines lunge at unprotected skin and spiders, web and all, catch rides on the first bike through. After some good pedaling unmolested by a dividing trail, you\'ll reach a wide dirt road, 4.3 miles. The singletrack begins again on the opposite side of the road after a short jog to the right. At 4.4 miles, ride straight through a 4-way. Stay on the main trail, known as Mustang, as it sweeps back and forth, in and out of the trees, then finally out again. Ignore a trail back on the right at 5.5 miles. Just beyond, the trail splits again and this time bear right.

From here, still out in the open of a clearcut, the singletrack gradually widens. Reach a 4-way of dirt roads at 5.7 miles and proceed straight ahead. At 5.9 miles, arrive at a complicated 4-way intersection at a major gravel road - turn right onto the wide gravel road, ignoring the lesser cut-off road immediately prior on your right. Ride toward a conspicuous stand of trees about one quarter-mile ahead. When the road forks at 6.0 miles, bear right. Ignore a lesser road on the left at 6.1 miles. Bear left at the fork at 6.2 miles. Just when you\'ve had enough of the road riding, find a singletrack on the right, 6.4 miles, that enters that conspicuous stand of trees. This trail is called Cut Your Bars, although after years of use it\'s not quite that technical anymore. 

At 6.7 miles, the trail pops out at a 4-way (three roads, plus your trail). Turn right on the road. When the road forks at 6.9 miles, go left on a narrow dirt road. Ignore a tasty looking singletrack on the right at 7.0 miles. But at 7.1 miles, find another singletrack and turn right. This small area, often referred to as Snickers, bound by the narrow road behind and the Access Road ahead, contains a maze of fun, zippy trails - and a few tours through the maze are well worth your while. At 7.2 miles, reach a fork and bear left. At 7.3 miles, reach a fork and go right. Bear right again at the next fork, then drop down to reach Access Road at 7.5 miles, then turn left. When you arrive at the 4-way, 7.6 miles, you\'ve connected the loop. Go straight through the 4-way, around the gate, and glide back to the parking area at the Christmas tree farm, 7.8 miles. 

Directions: From Bellevue, take Interstate 405 south to Exit 2 in Tukwila. Then head south on Highway 167 toward Puyallup. Take the Highway 410 Exit toward Yakima, and drive east just over 5.5 miles to Bonney Lake. Turn right on South Prairie Road E., and set your odometer to zero. At 1.5 miles, turn right on 214th Avenue E. At 2.4 miles, turn right on 120th Street E. Reach a T at 3.2 miles, and turn left onto 198th Avenue E. At 3.7 miles, find Hillside Farms Christmas Trees on the right. Show some mountain bike courtesy: Don\'t litter or relieve yourself in the parking lot.

"," The huge parcel of land south of Highway 410, bounded by the Puyallup River to the west, the Carbon River to the south, and 198th Avenue E. to the east, commonly known as Victor Falls, is one of the premier mountain bike spots in the south Puget Sound region, and it's all private property.   
A phenomenal number of trails and dirt roads, ranging from easy to technical, crisscross the site, making for excellent exploring. If you want to get lost, this is the place to ride. This loop functions as an excellent introduction to Victor Falls. If you can find it, check out Jim Hendricks' map of the area, which remains remarkably accurate despite logging and some blocks of new houses. Of course more new houses are slated for this area, and logging (in advance of development) may obliterate or re-route even more trails. So be prepared for changes. It must be noted that for years our heroes at Hillside Farms Christmas Trees have allowed mountain bikers to park in the lot from January through the end of October. Don't trash the parking area! Please respect the closure dates so they can sell trees - and they'd sure like it if you bought your Christmas tree there. It should also be noted that the landowner tolerates non-motorized use; be a good citizen out on the trails so we can keep it that way.

With many miles of mountain biking trails spanning a wide variety of skill levels and physical challenge - including a bona fide double-diamond DH trail and killer views of Mount Rainier from the summit - Tiger Mountain is one of Seattle's most popular mountain biking destinations.

All trails are open year round, but during the winter months or after significant weather events, the trails are subject to closures: check for updates on this page and on the DNR's Tiger Mountain page here.

There are also many miles of logging roads that are open all year long, but these too may be closed (typically for timber harvest).  Check the DNR link above.

Preston Railroad Grade is also fast but more technical than the Summit Trail, with roots, rocks, some gnar sections and some switchbacks.  It requires very little pedaling in the downhill direction, but can be ridden either way.  It's a challenge in the climbing direction!

You can get lost in Fox Park quite easily (I do all the time), so give yourself a big window of time.  Also, please don't pay too much attention to the trail length I gave.  I honestly can't tell you how far back this goes.  <br />
<br />
This place has a good bit of variety, but it is mostly rocky/root-y single track that you'll be crawling up or flying down.  There are some features mixed into the trails.  A large 15+ foot log with the top hacked flat crosses a stream, a rather arbitrary boardwalk which reaches about 10 feet tall x 30 feet long you can ride down through the pine trees, and a dirt jump section which includes a few smaller jumps, an inclined log, some random log I think you're supposed to hop onto, and the coolest thing, a 3 foot high jump which throws you onto a steep decline at the bottom of which begins a 20 foot boardwalk/ramp that ends with a 6 - 7 foot gap.  I ate dirt my first and only time, and my shin's still numb from where I banged it on the ground.  So, Fox Park definitely has some cool stuff and it needs to really be explored!  A lot of stream crossings could be cause for some more bridges, because I find myself walking across more than riding through.<br />
<br />
The best strategy, I think, is to climb to the highest point you can, which inevitably leads to the dirt jump section ... maybe.  Honestly, someone needs to map that place.  It's also a place where some swamp walks could be a huuuuuuuuuuge benefit.  Anybody looking to develop a trail, check out Fox Park!","From I-93 North or South, take exit 25 and turn right.  Once you hit the traffic circle, take the third exit and drive through town.  The road will fork right after the post office, and so you want to continue right.  Watch out for college students and pedestrians!  Go up the hill, past the bank, and take a left at the blinking yellow light onto Langdon St.  Continue through a four-way stop, and you want to take a right following the funeral home.  The Fox Park parking lot is on your left.  There are a few entrances to the trail, but the best way I think is to ride your bike past the playground and pavilion.

7,284906,Gyro,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/gyro/,2.0,"Alright, so the first trail on the right leads to this small dirt bowl with some smaller jumps (big enough for me) where you can have some fun.  In the middle of the bowl, if you take a left, you'll hit some of the fastest single track in the Gyro, which has wider turns, is mostly flat, and with some nice dips here and there.  Also a  long 2 x 4 that clears a gap you can skip if you're not comfortable with it.  Follow the track and it will come out close to the river (this is also where one of the other trails connects, so be on the lookout for other bikers).  Take the track along the lake and continue on (you'll see some smaller dirt jumps), ride over the see-saw, and you'll be out of the system and amidst some small houses.  You're back out on the road.  Take a right, and you can go back to the gas station.<br />
<br />
The second trailhead on the right begins the twistier single track where you'll have to watch your handlebars and weasel through some tighter spots.  This track is the longest, goes all over the place, comes out close to the river, but then turns back into the woods.  The trail will pass through a clearing and end up where that first trail comes out.  You can either continue on toward the river and finish out on the road, or you can turn on the faster single track and end your trip with the dirt bowl and come back out on the dirt service road. The trail on the left is not very twisty, it's quite short (fun too), and will pass by an impressive BMX/DJ section, before coming out in the parking lot of the first gas station you had earlier passed.  Try to turn it all into a big loop! <br />
<br />
Optional: If you want, keep taking that dirt service road back, go over an old bridge with holes in it, and into a field.  Best in the springtime when the grass is lower, but still very Little House on the Prairie any time of year.  If you see ATV/bike tracks, follow them and watch out for animal dwellings.

Get on your bike, get back to the main road, and cross over to the gas station.  Take a left, see the service road between the two gas stations, and get on it.

7,286025,Victor Falls,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/victor-falls/,8.0,"From the parking area, pedal away from 198th Avenue, up a dirt road known as the Main Access Road. At 0.2 miles, pass around a gate. Almost immediately, reach a 4-way and turn left onto a wide trail known as Elevator. Right away it narrows and ascends steeply. Stay on the main trail as you climb, ignoring two trails on the right. The trail crests and seems to end at a dirt road, 0.8 mile. Across the road on the right, though, the trail continues. From here, the trail, known as Route 66, winds then drops. Pass straight through a 4-way at 1.0 mile. At 1.2 miles, reach a T and turn left. At 1.4 miles, reach another T and turn right. Descend and then wind around a swale of low brush that contains the hulk of a white truck. Arrive at a T at 1.8 miles, and turn left. The trail ends at 198th Avenue at 1.9 miles - turn right and ride alongside the paved road. 

At 2.1 miles, find a singletrack that exits the road on the right and take it. The trail winds and twists. Ride straight through a 4-way at 2.4 miles. When the trail divides, 2.7 miles, stay to the right. Pedal straight through another 4-way at 2.9 miles. Reach a gravel road at 3.2 miles - hop on the slightly technical singletrack that continues on the opposite side. When the trail forks, bear right. Reach a T at a narrow road, 3.3 miles, and go right, descending. At 3.6 miles, reach a T and turn right. The narrow road forks at 3.7 miles - bear left. At 3.8 miles, immediately before reaching a T, turn right on a singletrack. Whoa - this is an easy turn to miss. 

The trail, narrow and winding, heads north and is at times brushy and overgrown, as blackberry vines lunge at unprotected skin and spiders, web and all, catch rides on the first bike through. After some good pedaling unmolested by a dividing trail, you\'ll reach a wide dirt road, 4.3 miles. The singletrack begins again on the opposite side of the road after a short jog to the right. At 4.4 miles, ride straight through a 4-way. Stay on the main trail, known as Mustang, as it sweeps back and forth, in and out of the trees, then finally out again. Ignore a trail back on the right at 5.5 miles. Just beyond, the trail splits again and this time bear right.

From here, still out in the open of a clearcut, the singletrack gradually widens. Reach a 4-way of dirt roads at 5.7 miles and proceed straight ahead. At 5.9 miles, arrive at a complicated 4-way intersection at a major gravel road - turn right onto the wide gravel road, ignoring the lesser cut-off road immediately prior on your right. Ride toward a conspicuous stand of trees about one quarter-mile ahead. When the road forks at 6.0 miles, bear right. Ignore a lesser road on the left at 6.1 miles. Bear left at the fork at 6.2 miles. Just when you\'ve had enough of the road riding, find a singletrack on the right, 6.4 miles, that enters that conspicuous stand of trees. This trail is called Cut Your Bars, although after years of use it\'s not quite that technical anymore. 

At 6.7 miles, the trail pops out at a 4-way (three roads, plus your trail). Turn right on the road. When the road forks at 6.9 miles, go left on a narrow dirt road. Ignore a tasty looking singletrack on the right at 7.0 miles. But at 7.1 miles, find another singletrack and turn right. This small area, often referred to as Snickers, bound by the narrow road behind and the Access Road ahead, contains a maze of fun, zippy trails - and a few tours through the maze are well worth your while. At 7.2 miles, reach a fork and bear left. At 7.3 miles, reach a fork and go right. Bear right again at the next fork, then drop down to reach Access Road at 7.5 miles, then turn left. When you arrive at the 4-way, 7.6 miles, you\'ve connected the loop. Go straight through the 4-way, around the gate, and glide back to the parking area at the Christmas tree farm, 7.8 miles. 

Directions: From Bellevue, take Interstate 405 south to Exit 2 in Tukwila. Then head south on Highway 167 toward Puyallup. Take the Highway 410 Exit toward Yakima, and drive east just over 5.5 miles to Bonney Lake. Turn right on South Prairie Road E., and set your odometer to zero. At 1.5 miles, turn right on 214th Avenue E. At 2.4 miles, turn right on 120th Street E. Reach a T at 3.2 miles, and turn left onto 198th Avenue E. At 3.7 miles, find Hillside Farms Christmas Trees on the right. Show some mountain bike courtesy: Don\'t litter or relieve yourself in the parking lot.

"," The huge parcel of land south of Highway 410, bounded by the Puyallup River to the west, the Carbon River to the south, and 198th Avenue E. to the east, commonly known as Victor Falls, is one of the premier mountain bike spots in the south Puget Sound region, and it's all private property.   
A phenomenal number of trails and dirt roads, ranging from easy to technical, crisscross the site, making for excellent exploring. If you want to get lost, this is the place to ride. This loop functions as an excellent introduction to Victor Falls. If you can find it, check out Jim Hendricks' map of the area, which remains remarkably accurate despite logging and some blocks of new houses. Of course more new houses are slated for this area, and logging (in advance of development) may obliterate or re-route even more trails. So be prepared for changes. It must be noted that for years our heroes at Hillside Farms Christmas Trees have allowed mountain bikers to park in the lot from January through the end of October. Don't trash the parking area! Please respect the closure dates so they can sell trees - and they'd sure like it if you bought your Christmas tree there. It should also be noted that the landowner tolerates non-motorized use; be a good citizen out on the trails so we can keep it that way.

With many miles of mountain biking trails spanning a wide variety of skill levels and physical challenge - including a bona fide double-diamond DH trail and killer views of Mount Rainier from the summit - Tiger Mountain is one of Seattle's most popular mountain biking destinations.

All trails are open year round, but during the winter months or after significant weather events, the trails are subject to closures: check for updates on this page and on the DNR's Tiger Mountain page here.

There are also many miles of logging roads that are open all year long, but these too may be closed (typically for timber harvest).  Check the DNR link above.

6,284910,Fox Park,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/fox-park/,10.0,"Let me start off by saying I wish someone would GPS this trail.  You can get lost in Fox Park quite easily (I do all the time), so give yourself a big window of time.  Also, please don't pay too much attention to the trail length I gave.  I honestly can't tell you how far back this goes.  <br />
<br />
This place has a good bit of variety, but it is mostly rocky/root-y single track that you'll be crawling up or flying down.  There are some features mixed into the trails.  A large 15+ foot log with the top hacked flat crosses a stream, a rather arbitrary boardwalk which reaches about 10 feet tall x 30 feet long you can ride down through the pine trees, and a dirt jump section which includes a few smaller jumps, an inclined log, some random log I think you're supposed to hop onto, and the coolest thing, a 3 foot high jump which throws you onto a steep decline at the bottom of which begins a 20 foot boardwalk/ramp that ends with a 6 - 7 foot gap.  I ate dirt my first and only time, and my shin's still numb from where I banged it on the ground.  So, Fox Park definitely has some cool stuff and it needs to really be explored!  A lot of stream crossings could be cause for some more bridges, because I find myself walking across more than riding through.<br />
<br />
The best strategy, I think, is to climb to the highest point you can, which inevitably leads to the dirt jump section ... maybe.  Honestly, someone needs to map that place.  It's also a place where some swamp walks could be a huuuuuuuuuuge benefit.  Anybody looking to develop a trail, check out Fox Park!","From I-93 North or South, take exit 25 and turn right.  Once you hit the traffic circle, take the third exit and drive through town.  The road will fork right after the post office, and so you want to continue right.  Watch out for college students and pedestrians!  Go up the hill, past the bank, and take a left at the blinking yellow light onto Langdon St.  Continue through a four-way stop, and you want to take a right following the funeral home.  The Fox Park parking lot is on your left.  There are a few entrances to the trail, but the best way I think is to ride your bike past the playground and pavilion.

7,284906,Gyro,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/gyro/,2.0,"Alright, so the first trail on the right leads to this small dirt bowl with some smaller jumps (big enough for me) where you can have some fun.  In the middle of the bowl, if you take a left, you'll hit some of the fastest single track in the Gyro, which has wider turns, is mostly flat, and with some nice dips here and there.  Also a  long 2 x 4 that clears a gap you can skip if you're not comfortable with it.  Follow the track and it will come out close to the river (this is also where one of the other trails connects, so be on the lookout for other bikers).  Take the track along the lake and continue on (you'll see some smaller dirt jumps), ride over the see-saw, and you'll be out of the system and amidst some small houses.  You're back out on the road.  Take a right, and you can go back to the gas station.<br />
<br />
The second trailhead on the right begins the twistier single track where you'll have to watch your handlebars and weasel through some tighter spots.  This track is the longest, goes all over the place, comes out close to the river, but then turns back into the woods.  The trail will pass through a clearing and end up where that first trail comes out.  You can either continue on toward the river and finish out on the road, or you can turn on the faster single track and end your trip with the dirt bowl and come back out on the dirt service road. The trail on the left is not very twisty, it's quite short (fun too), and will pass by an impressive BMX/DJ section, before coming out in the parking lot of the first gas station you had earlier passed.  Try to turn it all into a big loop! <br />
<br />
Optional: If you want, keep taking that dirt service road back, go over an old bridge with holes in it, and into a field.  Best in the springtime when the grass is lower, but still very Little House on the Prairie any time of year.  If you see ATV/bike tracks, follow them and watch out for animal dwellings.  This leads (hopefully) to gravel road that you climb to a paved road.  Take a left, go down the road, take another left onto the next road (175), and ride back into Plymouth.  ","This one's super easy.  On I-93, North or South, take exit 25 and turn right.  You'll pass by two gas stations on your left.

Get on your bike, get back to the main road, and cross over to the gas station.  Take a left, see the service road between the two gas stations, and get on it.

Stay on the main trail as you climb, ignoring two trails on the right. The trail crests and seems to end at a dirt road, 0.8 mile. Across the road on the right, though, the trail continues. From here, the trail, known as Route 66, winds then drops. Pass straight through a 4-way at 1.0 mile. At 1.2 miles, reach a T and turn left. At 1.4 miles, reach another T and turn right. Descend and then wind around a swale of low brush that contains the hulk of a white truck. Arrive at a T at 1.8 miles, and turn left. The trail ends at 198th Avenue at 1.9 miles - turn right and ride alongside the paved road. 

At 2.1 miles, find a singletrack that exits the road on the right and take it. The trail winds and twists. Ride straight through a 4-way at 2.4 miles. When the trail divides, 2.7 miles, stay to the right. Pedal straight through another 4-way at 2.9 miles. Reach a gravel road at 3.2 miles - hop on the slightly technical singletrack that continues on the opposite side. When the trail forks, bear right. Reach a T at a narrow road, 3.3 miles, and go right, descending. At 3.6 miles, reach a T and turn right. The narrow road forks at 3.7 miles - bear left. At 3.8 miles, immediately before reaching a T, turn right on a singletrack. Whoa - this is an easy turn to miss. 

The trail, narrow and winding, heads north and is at times brushy and overgrown, as blackberry vines lunge at unprotected skin and spiders, web and all, catch rides on the first bike through. After some good pedaling unmolested by a dividing trail, you\'ll reach a wide dirt road, 4.3 miles. The singletrack begins again on the opposite side of the road after a short jog to the right. At 4.4 miles, ride straight through a 4-way. Stay on the main trail, known as Mustang, as it sweeps back and forth, in and out of the trees, then finally out again. Ignore a trail back on the right at 5.5 miles. Just beyond, the trail splits again and this time bear right.

From here, still out in the open of a clearcut, the singletrack gradually widens. Reach a 4-way of dirt roads at 5.7 miles and proceed straight ahead. At 5.9 miles, arrive at a complicated 4-way intersection at a major gravel road - turn right onto the wide gravel road, ignoring the lesser cut-off road immediately prior on your right. Ride toward a conspicuous stand of trees about one quarter-mile ahead. When the road forks at 6.0 miles, bear right. Ignore a lesser road on the left at 6.1 miles. Bear left at the fork at 6.2 miles. Just when you\'ve had enough of the road riding, find a singletrack on the right, 6.4 miles, that enters that conspicuous stand of trees. This trail is called Cut Your Bars, although after years of use it\'s not quite that technical anymore. 

At 6.7 miles, the trail pops out at a 4-way (three roads, plus your trail). Turn right on the road. When the road forks at 6.9 miles, go left on a narrow dirt road. Ignore a tasty looking singletrack on the right at 7.0 miles. But at 7.1 miles, find another singletrack and turn right. This small area, often referred to as Snickers, bound by the narrow road behind and the Access Road ahead, contains a maze of fun, zippy trails - and a few tours through the maze are well worth your while. At 7.2 miles, reach a fork and bear left. At 7.3 miles, reach a fork and go right. Bear right again at the next fork, then drop down to reach Access Road at 7.5 miles, then turn left. When you arrive at the 4-way, 7.6 miles, you\'ve connected the loop. Go straight through the 4-way, around the gate, and glide back to the parking area at the Christmas tree farm, 7.8 miles. 

Directions: From Bellevue, take Interstate 405 south to Exit 2 in Tukwila. Then head south on Highway 167 toward Puyallup. Take the Highway 410 Exit toward Yakima, and drive east just over 5.5 miles to Bonney Lake. Turn right on South Prairie Road E., and set your odometer to zero. At 1.5 miles, turn right on 214th Avenue E. At 2.4 miles, turn right on 120th Street E. Reach a T at 3.2 miles, and turn left onto 198th Avenue E. At 3.7 miles, find Hillside Farms Christmas Trees on the right. Show some mountain bike courtesy: Don\'t litter or relieve yourself in the parking lot.

"," The huge parcel of land south of Highway 410, bounded by the Puyallup River to the west, the Carbon River to the south, and 198th Avenue E. to the east, commonly known as Victor Falls, is one of the premier mountain bike spots in the south Puget Sound region, and it's all private property.   
A phenomenal number of trails and dirt roads, ranging from easy to technical, crisscross the site, making for excellent exploring. If you want to get lost, this is the place to ride. This loop functions as an excellent introduction to Victor Falls. If you can find it, check out Jim Hendricks' map of the area, which remains remarkably accurate despite logging and some blocks of new houses. Of course more new houses are slated for this area, and logging (in advance of development) may obliterate or re-route even more trails. So be prepared for changes. It must be noted that for years our heroes at Hillside Farms Christmas Trees have allowed mountain bikers to park in the lot from January through the end of October. Don't trash the parking area! Please respect the closure dates so they can sell trees - and they'd sure like it if you bought your Christmas tree there. It should also be noted that the landowner tolerates non-motorized use; be a good citizen out on the trails so we can keep it that way.

6,284910,Fox Park,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/fox-park/,10.0,"Let me start off by saying I wish someone would GPS this trail.  You can get lost in Fox Park quite easily (I do all the time), so give yourself a big window of time.  Also, please don't pay too much attention to the trail length I gave.  I honestly can't tell you how far back this goes.  <br />
<br />
This place has a good bit of variety, but it is mostly rocky/root-y single track that you'll be crawling up or flying down.  There are some features mixed into the trails.  A large 15+ foot log with the top hacked flat crosses a stream, a rather arbitrary boardwalk which reaches about 10 feet tall x 30 feet long you can ride down through the pine trees, and a dirt jump section which includes a few smaller jumps, an inclined log, some random log I think you're supposed to hop onto, and the coolest thing, a 3 foot high jump which throws you onto a steep decline at the bottom of which begins a 20 foot boardwalk/ramp that ends with a 6 - 7 foot gap.  I ate dirt my first and only time, and my shin's still numb from where I banged it on the ground.  So, Fox Park definitely has some cool stuff and it needs to really be explored!  A lot of stream crossings could be cause for some more bridges, because I find myself walking across more than riding through.<br />
<br />
The best strategy, I think, is to climb to the highest point you can, which inevitably leads to the dirt jump section ... maybe.  Honestly, someone needs to map that place.  It's also a place where some swamp walks could be a huuuuuuuuuuge benefit.  Anybody looking to develop a trail, check out Fox Park!","From I-93 North or South, take exit 25 and turn right.  Once you hit the traffic circle, take the third exit and drive through town.  The road will fork right after the post office, and so you want to continue right.  Watch out for college students and pedestrians!  Go up the hill, past the bank, and take a left at the blinking yellow light onto Langdon St.  Continue through a four-way stop, and you want to take a right following the funeral home.  The Fox Park parking lot is on your left.  There are a few entrances to the trail, but the best way I think is to ride your bike past the playground and pavilion.

7,284906,Gyro,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/gyro/,2.0,"Alright, so the first trail on the right leads to this small dirt bowl with some smaller jumps (big enough for me) where you can have some fun.  In the middle of the bowl, if you take a left, you'll hit some of the fastest single track in the Gyro, which has wider turns, is mostly flat, and with some nice dips here and there.  Also a  long 2 x 4 that clears a gap you can skip if you're not comfortable with it.  Follow the track and it will come out close to the river (this is also where one of the other trails connects, so be on the lookout for other bikers).  Take the track along the lake and continue on (you'll see some smaller dirt jumps), ride over the see-saw, and you'll be out of the system and amidst some small houses.  You're back out on the road.  Take a right, and you can go back to the gas station.<br />
<br />
The second trailhead on the right begins the twistier single track where you'll have to watch your handlebars and weasel through some tighter spots.  This track is the longest, goes all over the place, comes out close to the river, but then turns back into the woods.  The trail will pass through a clearing and end up where that first trail comes out.  You can either continue on toward the river and finish out on the road, or you can turn on the faster single track and end your trip with the dirt bowl and come back out on the dirt service road. The trail on the left is not very twisty, it's quite short (fun too), and will pass by an impressive BMX/DJ section, before coming out in the parking lot of the first gas station you had earlier passed.  Try to turn it all into a big loop! <br />
<br />
Optional: If you want, keep taking that dirt service road back, go over an old bridge with holes in it, and into a field.  Best in the springtime when the grass is lower, but still very Little House on the Prairie any time of year.  If you see ATV/bike tracks, follow them and watch out for animal dwellings.  This leads (hopefully) to gravel road that you climb to a paved road.  Take a left, go down the road, take another left onto the next road (175), and ride back into Plymouth.  ","This one's super easy.  On I-93, North or South, take exit 25 and turn right.  You'll pass by two gas stations on your left.

Get on your bike, get back to the main road, and cross over to the gas station.  Take a left, see the service road between the two gas stations, and get on it.

From here, still out in the open of a clearcut, the singletrack gradually widens. Reach a 4-way of dirt roads at 5.7 miles and proceed straight ahead. At 5.9 miles, arrive at a complicated 4-way intersection at a major gravel road - turn right onto the wide gravel road, ignoring the lesser cut-off road immediately prior on your right. Ride toward a conspicuous stand of trees about one quarter-mile ahead. When the road forks at 6.0 miles, bear right. Ignore a lesser road on the left at 6.1 miles. Bear left at the fork at 6.2 miles. Just when you\'ve had enough of the road riding, find a singletrack on the right, 6.4 miles, that enters that conspicuous stand of trees. This trail is called Cut Your Bars, although after years of use it\'s not quite that technical anymore. 

At 6.7 miles, the trail pops out at a 4-way (three roads, plus your trail). Turn right on the road. When the road forks at 6.9 miles, go left on a narrow dirt road. Ignore a tasty looking singletrack on the right at 7.0 miles. But at 7.1 miles, find another singletrack and turn right. This small area, often referred to as Snickers, bound by the narrow road behind and the Access Road ahead, contains a maze of fun, zippy trails - and a few tours through the maze are well worth your while. At 7.2 miles, reach a fork and bear left. At 7.3 miles, reach a fork and go right. Bear right again at the next fork, then drop down to reach Access Road at 7.5 miles, then turn left. When you arrive at the 4-way, 7.6 miles, you\'ve connected the loop. Go straight through the 4-way, around the gate, and glide back to the parking area at the Christmas tree farm, 7.8 miles. 

Directions: From Bellevue, take Interstate 405 south to Exit 2 in Tukwila. Then head south on Highway 167 toward Puyallup. Take the Highway 410 Exit toward Yakima, and drive east just over 5.5 miles to Bonney Lake. Turn right on South Prairie Road E., and set your odometer to zero. At 1.5 miles, turn right on 214th Avenue E. At 2.4 miles, turn right on 120th Street E. Reach a T at 3.2 miles, and turn left onto 198th Avenue E. At 3.7 miles, find Hillside Farms Christmas Trees on the right. Show some mountain bike courtesy: Don\'t litter or relieve yourself in the parking lot.

"," The huge parcel of land south of Highway 410, bounded by the Puyallup River to the west, the Carbon River to the south, and 198th Avenue E. to the east, commonly known as Victor Falls, is one of the premier mountain bike spots in the south Puget Sound region, and it's all private property.   
A phenomenal number of trails and dirt roads, ranging from easy to technical, crisscross the site, making for excellent exploring. If you want to get lost, this is the place to ride. This loop functions as an excellent introduction to Victor Falls. If you can find it, check out Jim Hendricks' map of the area, which remains remarkably accurate despite logging and some blocks of new houses. Of course more new houses are slated for this area, and logging (in advance of development) may obliterate or re-route even more trails. So be prepared for changes. It must be noted that for years our heroes at Hillside Farms Christmas Trees have allowed mountain bikers to park in the lot from January through the end of October. Don't trash the parking area! Please respect the closure dates so they can sell trees - and they'd sure like it if you bought your Christmas tree there. It should also be noted that the landowner tolerates non-motorized use; be a good citizen out on the trails so we can keep it that way.

6,284910,Fox Park,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/fox-park/,10.0,"Let me start off by saying I wish someone would GPS this trail.  You can get lost in Fox Park quite easily (I do all the time), so give yourself a big window of time.  Also, please don't pay too much attention to the trail length I gave.  I honestly can't tell you how far back this goes.  <br />
<br />
This place has a good bit of variety, but it is mostly rocky/root-y single track that you'll be crawling up or flying down.  There are some features mixed into the trails.  A large 15+ foot log with the top hacked flat crosses a stream, a rather arbitrary boardwalk which reaches about 10 feet tall x 30 feet long you can ride down through the pine trees, and a dirt jump section which includes a few smaller jumps, an inclined log, some random log I think you're supposed to hop onto, and the coolest thing, a 3 foot high jump which throws you onto a steep decline at the bottom of which begins a 20 foot boardwalk/ramp that ends with a 6 - 7 foot gap.  I ate dirt my first and only time, and my shin's still numb from where I banged it on the ground.  So, Fox Park definitely has some cool stuff and it needs to really be explored!  A lot of stream crossings could be cause for some more bridges, because I find myself walking across more than riding through.<br />
<br />
The best strategy, I think, is to climb to the highest point you can, which inevitably leads to the dirt jump section ... maybe.  Honestly, someone needs to map that place.  It's also a place where some swamp walks could be a huuuuuuuuuuge benefit.  Anybody looking to develop a trail, check out Fox Park!","From I-93 North or South, take exit 25 and turn right.  Once you hit the traffic circle, take the third exit and drive through town.  The road will fork right after the post office, and so you want to continue right.  Watch out for college students and pedestrians!  Go up the hill, past the bank, and take a left at the blinking yellow light onto Langdon St.  Continue through a four-way stop, and you want to take a right following the funeral home.  The Fox Park parking lot is on your left.  There are a few entrances to the trail, but the best way I think is to ride your bike past the playground and pavilion.  Should be one trailhead that starts there.",Plymouth,New Hampshire,United States,43.75234,-71.69273,Advanced,,3.0,https://images.singletracks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Fox-Park-0-orig.jpg
7,284906,Gyro,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/gyro/,2.0,"Alright, so the first trail on the right leads to this small dirt bowl with some smaller jumps (big enough for me) where you can have some fun.  In the middle of the bowl, if you take a left, you'll hit some of the fastest single track in the Gyro, which has wider turns, is mostly flat, and with some nice dips here and there.  Also a  long 2 x 4 that clears a gap you can skip if you're not comfortable with it.  Follow the track and it will come out close to the river (this is also where one of the other trails connects, so be on the lookout for other bikers).  Take the track along the lake and continue on (you'll see some smaller dirt jumps), ride over the see-saw, and you'll be out of the system and amidst some small houses.  You're back out on the road.  Take a right, and you can go back to the gas station.<br />
<br />
The second trailhead on the right begins the twistier single track where you'll have to watch your handlebars and weasel through some tighter spots.  This track is the longest, goes all over the place, comes out close to the river, but then turns back into the woods.  The trail will pass through a clearing and end up where that first trail comes out.  You can either continue on toward the river and finish out on the road, or you can turn on the faster single track and end your trip with the dirt bowl and come back out on the dirt service road. The trail on the left is not very twisty, it's quite short (fun too), and will pass by an impressive BMX/DJ section, before coming out in the parking lot of the first gas station you had earlier passed.  Try to turn it all into a big loop! <br />
<br />
Optional: If you want, keep taking that dirt service road back, go over an old bridge with holes in it, and into a field.  Best in the springtime when the grass is lower, but still very Little House on the Prairie any time of year.  If you see ATV/bike tracks, follow them and watch out for animal dwellings.  This leads (hopefully) to gravel road that you climb to a paved road.  Take a left, go down the road, take another left onto the next road (175), and ride back into Plymouth.  ","This one's super easy.  On I-93, North or South, take exit 25 and turn right.  You'll pass by two gas stations on your left.  Across from the second gas station is the road that leads to Plymouth State's gym parking lot, in which there is a guest section (no overnight parking).  Get on your bike, get back to the main road, and cross over to the gas station.  Take a left, see the service road between the two gas stations, and get on it.

At 0.2 miles, pass around a gate. Almost immediately, reach a 4-way and turn left onto a wide trail known as Elevator. Right away it narrows and ascends steeply. Stay on the main trail as you climb, ignoring two trails on the right. The trail crests and seems to end at a dirt road, 0.8 mile. Across the road on the right, though, the trail continues. From here, the trail, known as Route 66, winds then drops. Pass straight through a 4-way at 1.0 mile. At 1.2 miles, reach a T and turn left. At 1.4 miles, reach another T and turn right. Descend and then wind around a swale of low brush that contains the hulk of a white truck. Arrive at a T at 1.8 miles, and turn left. The trail ends at 198th Avenue at 1.9 miles - turn right and ride alongside the paved road. 

At 2.1 miles, find a singletrack that exits the road on the right and take it. The trail winds and twists. Ride straight through a 4-way at 2.4 miles. When the trail divides, 2.7 miles, stay to the right. Pedal straight through another 4-way at 2.9 miles. Reach a gravel road at 3.2 miles - hop on the slightly technical singletrack that continues on the opposite side. When the trail forks, bear right. Reach a T at a narrow road, 3.3 miles, and go right, descending. At 3.6 miles, reach a T and turn right. The narrow road forks at 3.7 miles - bear left. At 3.8 miles, immediately before reaching a T, turn right on a singletrack. Whoa - this is an easy turn to miss. 

The trail, narrow and winding, heads north and is at times brushy and overgrown, as blackberry vines lunge at unprotected skin and spiders, web and all, catch rides on the first bike through. After some good pedaling unmolested by a dividing trail, you\'ll reach a wide dirt road, 4.3 miles. The singletrack begins again on the opposite side of the road after a short jog to the right. At 4.4 miles, ride straight through a 4-way. Stay on the main trail, known as Mustang, as it sweeps back and forth, in and out of the trees, then finally out again. Ignore a trail back on the right at 5.5 miles. Just beyond, the trail splits again and this time bear right.

From here, still out in the open of a clearcut, the singletrack gradually widens. Reach a 4-way of dirt roads at 5.7 miles and proceed straight ahead. At 5.9 miles, arrive at a complicated 4-way intersection at a major gravel road - turn right onto the wide gravel road, ignoring the lesser cut-off road immediately prior on your right. Ride toward a conspicuous stand of trees about one quarter-mile ahead. When the road forks at 6.0 miles, bear right. Ignore a lesser road on the left at 6.1 miles. Bear left at the fork at 6.2 miles. Just when you\'ve had enough of the road riding, find a singletrack on the right, 6.4 miles, that enters that conspicuous stand of trees. This trail is called Cut Your Bars, although after years of use it\'s not quite that technical anymore. 

At 6.7 miles, the trail pops out at a 4-way (three roads, plus your trail). Turn right on the road. When the road forks at 6.9 miles, go left on a narrow dirt road. Ignore a tasty looking singletrack on the right at 7.0 miles. But at 7.1 miles, find another singletrack and turn right. This small area, often referred to as Snickers, bound by the narrow road behind and the Access Road ahead, contains a maze of fun, zippy trails - and a few tours through the maze are well worth your while. At 7.2 miles, reach a fork and bear left. At 7.3 miles, reach a fork and go right. Bear right again at the next fork, then drop down to reach Access Road at 7.5 miles, then turn left. When you arrive at the 4-way, 7.6 miles, you\'ve connected the loop. Go straight through the 4-way, around the gate, and glide back to the parking area at the Christmas tree farm, 7.8 miles.

Take the Highway 410 Exit toward Yakima, and drive east just over 5.5 miles to Bonney Lake. Turn right on South Prairie Road E., and set your odometer to zero. At 1.5 miles, turn right on 214th Avenue E. At 2.4 miles, turn right on 120th Street E. Reach a T at 3.2 miles, and turn left onto 198th Avenue E. At 3.7 miles, find Hillside Farms Christmas Trees on the right. Show some mountain bike courtesy: Don\'t litter or relieve yourself in the parking lot.

"," The huge parcel of land south of Highway 410, bounded by the Puyallup River to the west, the Carbon River to the south, and 198th Avenue E. to the east, commonly known as Victor Falls, is one of the premier mountain bike spots in the south Puget Sound region, and it's all private property.   
A phenomenal number of trails and dirt roads, ranging from easy to technical, crisscross the site, making for excellent exploring. If you want to get lost, this is the place to ride. This loop functions as an excellent introduction to Victor Falls. If you can find it, check out Jim Hendricks' map of the area, which remains remarkably accurate despite logging and some blocks of new houses. Of course more new houses are slated for this area, and logging (in advance of development) may obliterate or re-route even more trails. So be prepared for changes. It must be noted that for years our heroes at Hillside Farms Christmas Trees have allowed mountain bikers to park in the lot from January through the end of October. Don't trash the parking area! Please respect the closure dates so they can sell trees - and they'd sure like it if you bought your Christmas tree there. It should also be noted that the landowner tolerates non-motorized use; be a good citizen out on the trails so we can keep it that way.

6,284910,Fox Park,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/fox-park/,10.0,"Let me start off by saying I wish someone would GPS this trail.  You can get lost in Fox Park quite easily (I do all the time), so give yourself a big window of time.  Also, please don't pay too much attention to the trail length I gave.  I honestly can't tell you how far back this goes.  <br />
<br />
This place has a good bit of variety, but it is mostly rocky/root-y single track that you'll be crawling up or flying down.  There are some features mixed into the trails.  A large 15+ foot log with the top hacked flat crosses a stream, a rather arbitrary boardwalk which reaches about 10 feet tall x 30 feet long you can ride down through the pine trees, and a dirt jump section which includes a few smaller jumps, an inclined log, some random log I think you're supposed to hop onto, and the coolest thing, a 3 foot high jump which throws you onto a steep decline at the bottom of which begins a 20 foot boardwalk/ramp that ends with a 6 - 7 foot gap.  I ate dirt my first and only time, and my shin's still numb from where I banged it on the ground.  So, Fox Park definitely has some cool stuff and it needs to really be explored!  A lot of stream crossings could be cause for some more bridges, because I find myself walking across more than riding through.<br />
<br />
The best strategy, I think, is to climb to the highest point you can, which inevitably leads to the dirt jump section ... maybe.  Honestly, someone needs to map that place.  It's also a place where some swamp walks could be a huuuuuuuuuuge benefit.  Anybody looking to develop a trail, check out Fox Park!","From I-93 North or South, take exit 25 and turn right.  Once you hit the traffic circle, take the third exit and drive through town.  The road will fork right after the post office, and so you want to continue right.  Watch out for college students and pedestrians!  Go up the hill, past the bank, and take a left at the blinking yellow light onto Langdon St.  Continue through a four-way stop, and you want to take a right following the funeral home.  The Fox Park parking lot is on your left.  There are a few entrances to the trail, but the best way I think is to ride your bike past the playground and pavilion.  Should be one trailhead that starts there.",Plymouth,New Hampshire,United States,43.75234,-71.69273,Advanced,,3.0,https://images.singletracks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Fox-Park-0-orig.jpg
7,284906,Gyro,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/gyro/,2.0,"Alright, so the first trail on the right leads to this small dirt bowl with some smaller jumps (big enough for me) where you can have some fun.  In the middle of the bowl, if you take a left, you'll hit some of the fastest single track in the Gyro, which has wider turns, is mostly flat, and with some nice dips here and there.  Also a  long 2 x 4 that clears a gap you can skip if you're not comfortable with it.  Follow the track and it will come out close to the river (this is also where one of the other trails connects, so be on the lookout for other bikers).  Take the track along the lake and continue on (you'll see some smaller dirt jumps), ride over the see-saw, and you'll be out of the system and amidst some small houses.  You're back out on the road.  Take a right, and you can go back to the gas station.<br />
<br />
The second trailhead on the right begins the twistier single track where you'll have to watch your handlebars and weasel through some tighter spots.  This track is the longest, goes all over the place, comes out close to the river, but then turns back into the woods.  The trail will pass through a clearing and end up where that first trail comes out.  You can either continue on toward the river and finish out on the road, or you can turn on the faster single track and end your trip with the dirt bowl and come back out on the dirt service road. The trail on the left is not very twisty, it's quite short (fun too), and will pass by an impressive BMX/DJ section, before coming out in the parking lot of the first gas station you had earlier passed.  Try to turn it all into a big loop! <br />
<br />
Optional: If you want, keep taking that dirt service road back, go over an old bridge with holes in it, and into a field.  Best in the springtime when the grass is lower, but still very Little House on the Prairie any time of year.  If you see ATV/bike tracks, follow them and watch out for animal dwellings.  This leads (hopefully) to gravel road that you climb to a paved road.  Take a left, go down the road, take another left onto the next road (175), and ride back into Plymouth.  ","This one's super easy.  On I-93, North or South, take exit 25 and turn right.  You'll pass by two gas stations on your left.  Across from the second gas station is the road that leads to Plymouth State's gym parking lot, in which there is a guest section (no overnight parking).  Get on your bike, get back to the main road, and cross over to the gas station.  Take a left, see the service road between the two gas stations, and get on it.  Keep on going and you'll see a trail on the right ... then a trail on the left, then another trail on the right.

At 0.2 miles, pass around a gate. Almost immediately, reach a 4-way and turn left onto a wide trail known as Elevator. Right away it narrows and ascends steeply. Stay on the main trail as you climb, ignoring two trails on the right. The trail crests and seems to end at a dirt road, 0.8 mile. Across the road on the right, though, the trail continues. From here, the trail, known as Route 66, winds then drops. Pass straight through a 4-way at 1.0 mile. At 1.2 miles, reach a T and turn left. At 1.4 miles, reach another T and turn right. Descend and then wind around a swale of low brush that contains the hulk of a white truck. Arrive at a T at 1.8 miles, and turn left. The trail ends at 198th Avenue at 1.9 miles - turn right and ride alongside the paved road. 

At 2.1 miles, find a singletrack that exits the road on the right and take it. The trail winds and twists. Ride straight through a 4-way at 2.4 miles. When the trail divides, 2.7 miles, stay to the right. Pedal straight through another 4-way at 2.9 miles. Reach a gravel road at 3.2 miles - hop on the slightly technical singletrack that continues on the opposite side. When the trail forks, bear right. Reach a T at a narrow road, 3.3 miles, and go right, descending. At 3.6 miles, reach a T and turn right. The narrow road forks at 3.7 miles - bear left. At 3.8 miles, immediately before reaching a T, turn right on a singletrack. Whoa - this is an easy turn to miss. 

The trail, narrow and winding, heads north and is at times brushy and overgrown, as blackberry vines lunge at unprotected skin and spiders, web and all, catch rides on the first bike through. After some good pedaling unmolested by a dividing trail, you\'ll reach a wide dirt road, 4.3 miles. The singletrack begins again on the opposite side of the road after a short jog to the right. At 4.4 miles, ride straight through a 4-way. Stay on the main trail, known as Mustang, as it sweeps back and forth, in and out of the trees, then finally out again. Ignore a trail back on the right at 5.5 miles. Just beyond, the trail splits again and this time bear right.

From here, still out in the open of a clearcut, the singletrack gradually widens. Reach a 4-way of dirt roads at 5.7 miles and proceed straight ahead. At 5.9 miles, arrive at a complicated 4-way intersection at a major gravel road - turn right onto the wide gravel road, ignoring the lesser cut-off road immediately prior on your right. Ride toward a conspicuous stand of trees about one quarter-mile ahead. When the road forks at 6.0 miles, bear right. Ignore a lesser road on the left at 6.1 miles. Bear left at the fork at 6.2 miles. Just when you\'ve had enough of the road riding, find a singletrack on the right, 6.4 miles, that enters that conspicuous stand of trees. This trail is called Cut Your Bars, although after years of use it\'s not quite that technical anymore. 

At 6.7 miles, the trail pops out at a 4-way (three roads, plus your trail). Turn right on the road. When the road forks at 6.9 miles, go left on a narrow dirt road. Ignore a tasty looking singletrack on the right at 7.0 miles. But at 7.1 miles, find another singletrack and turn right. This small area, often referred to as Snickers, bound by the narrow road behind and the Access Road ahead, contains a maze of fun, zippy trails - and a few tours through the maze are well worth your while. At 7.2 miles, reach a fork and bear left. At 7.3 miles, reach a fork and go right. Bear right again at the next fork, then drop down to reach Access Road at 7.5 miles, then turn left. When you arrive at the 4-way, 7.6 miles, you\'ve connected the loop. Go straight through the 4-way, around the gate, and glide back to the parking area at the Christmas tree farm, 7.8 miles. 

Directions: From Bellevue, take Interstate 405 south to Exit 2 in Tukwila. Then head south on Highway 167 toward Puyallup. Take the Highway 410 Exit toward Yakima, and drive east just over 5.5 miles to Bonney Lake. Turn right on South Prairie Road E., and set your odometer to zero. At 1.5 miles, turn right on 214th Avenue E. At 2.4 miles, turn right on 120th Street E. Reach a T at 3.2 miles, and turn left onto 198th Avenue E. At 3.7 miles, find Hillside Farms Christmas Trees on the right. Show some mountain bike courtesy: Don\'t litter or relieve yourself in the parking lot.

"," The huge parcel of land south of Highway 410, bounded by the Puyallup River to the west, the Carbon River to the south, and 198th Avenue E. to the east, commonly known as Victor Falls, is one of the premier mountain bike spots in the south Puget Sound region, and it's all private property.   
A phenomenal number of trails and dirt roads, ranging from easy to technical, crisscross the site, making for excellent exploring. If you want to get lost, this is the place to ride. This loop functions as an excellent introduction to Victor Falls. If you can find it, check out Jim Hendricks' map of the area, which remains remarkably accurate despite logging and some blocks of new houses. Of course more new houses are slated for this area, and logging (in advance of development) may obliterate or re-route even more trails. So be prepared for changes. It must be noted that for years our heroes at Hillside Farms Christmas Trees have allowed mountain bikers to park in the lot from January through the end of October. Don't trash the parking area!

There are also many miles of logging roads that are open all year long, but these too may be closed (typically for timber harvest).  Check the DNR link above.

6,284910,Fox Park,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/fox-park/,10.0,"Let me start off by saying I wish someone would GPS this trail.  You can get lost in Fox Park quite easily (I do all the time), so give yourself a big window of time.  Also, please don't pay too much attention to the trail length I gave.  I honestly can't tell you how far back this goes.  <br />
<br />
This place has a good bit of variety, but it is mostly rocky/root-y single track that you'll be crawling up or flying down.  There are some features mixed into the trails.  A large 15+ foot log with the top hacked flat crosses a stream, a rather arbitrary boardwalk which reaches about 10 feet tall x 30 feet long you can ride down through the pine trees, and a dirt jump section which includes a few smaller jumps, an inclined log, some random log I think you're supposed to hop onto, and the coolest thing, a 3 foot high jump which throws you onto a steep decline at the bottom of which begins a 20 foot boardwalk/ramp that ends with a 6 - 7 foot gap.  I ate dirt my first and only time, and my shin's still numb from where I banged it on the ground.  So, Fox Park definitely has some cool stuff and it needs to really be explored!  A lot of stream crossings could be cause for some more bridges, because I find myself walking across more than riding through.<br />
<br />
The best strategy, I think, is to climb to the highest point you can, which inevitably leads to the dirt jump section ... maybe.  Honestly, someone needs to map that place.  It's also a place where some swamp walks could be a huuuuuuuuuuge benefit.  Anybody looking to develop a trail, check out Fox Park!","From I-93 North or South, take exit 25 and turn right.  Once you hit the traffic circle, take the third exit and drive through town.  The road will fork right after the post office, and so you want to continue right.  Watch out for college students and pedestrians!  Go up the hill, past the bank, and take a left at the blinking yellow light onto Langdon St.  Continue through a four-way stop, and you want to take a right following the funeral home.  The Fox Park parking lot is on your left.  There are a few entrances to the trail, but the best way I think is to ride your bike past the playground and pavilion.  Should be one trailhead that starts there.",Plymouth,New Hampshire,United States,43.75234,-71.69273,Advanced,,3.0,https://images.singletracks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Fox-Park-0-orig.jpg
7,284906,Gyro,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/gyro/,2.0,"Alright, so the first trail on the right leads to this small dirt bowl with some smaller jumps (big enough for me) where you can have some fun.  In the middle of the bowl, if you take a left, you'll hit some of the fastest single track in the Gyro, which has wider turns, is mostly flat, and with some nice dips here and there.  Also a  long 2 x 4 that clears a gap you can skip if you're not comfortable with it.  Follow the track and it will come out close to the river (this is also where one of the other trails connects, so be on the lookout for other bikers).  Take the track along the lake and continue on (you'll see some smaller dirt jumps), ride over the see-saw, and you'll be out of the system and amidst some small houses.  You're back out on the road.  Take a right, and you can go back to the gas station.<br />
<br />
The second trailhead on the right begins the twistier single track where you'll have to watch your handlebars and weasel through some tighter spots.  This track is the longest, goes all over the place, comes out close to the river, but then turns back into the woods.  The trail will pass through a clearing and end up where that first trail comes out.  You can either continue on toward the river and finish out on the road, or you can turn on the faster single track and end your trip with the dirt bowl and come back out on the dirt service road. The trail on the left is not very twisty, it's quite short (fun too), and will pass by an impressive BMX/DJ section, before coming out in the parking lot of the first gas station you had earlier passed.  Try to turn it all into a big loop! <br />
<br />
Optional: If you want, keep taking that dirt service road back, go over an old bridge with holes in it, and into a field.  Best in the springtime when the grass is lower, but still very Little House on the Prairie any time of year.  If you see ATV/bike tracks, follow them and watch out for animal dwellings.  This leads (hopefully) to gravel road that you climb to a paved road.  Take a left, go down the road, take another left onto the next road (175), and ride back into Plymouth.  ","This one's super easy.  On I-93, North or South, take exit 25 and turn right.  You'll pass by two gas stations on your left.  Across from the second gas station is the road that leads to Plymouth State's gym parking lot, in which there is a guest section (no overnight parking).  Get on your bike, get back to the main road, and cross over to the gas station.  Take a left, see the service road between the two gas stations, and get on it.  Keep on going and you'll see a trail on the right ... then a trail on the left, then another trail on the right.

Starting at the parking lot follow a short trail into the woods and then you can turn left or right. I suggest taking a left onto Bear Claw, ride it to Hard Hat.
