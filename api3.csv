284910,Fox Park,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/fox-park/,10.0,"Let me start off by saying I wish someone would GPS this trail.  You can get lost in Fox Park quite easily (I do all the time), so give yourself a big window of time.  Also, please don't pay too much attention to the trail length I gave.  I honestly can't tell you how far back this goes.  <br />
<br />
This place has a good bit of variety, but it is mostly rocky/root-y single track that you'll be crawling up or flying down.  There are some features mixed into the trails.  A large 15+ foot log with the top hacked flat crosses a stream, a rather arbitrary boardwalk which reaches about 10 feet tall x 30 feet long you can ride down through the pine trees, and a dirt jump section which includes a few smaller jumps, an inclined log, some random log I think you're supposed to hop onto, and the coolest thing, a 3 foot high jump which throws you onto a steep decline at the bottom of which begins a 20 foot boardwalk/ramp that ends with a 6 - 7 foot gap.  I ate dirt my first and only time, and my shin's still numb from where I banged it on the ground.  So, Fox Park definitely has some cool stuff and it needs to really be explored!  A lot of stream crossings could be cause for some more bridges, because I find myself walking across more than riding through.<br />
<br />
The best strategy, I think, is to climb to the highest point you can, which inevitably leads to the dirt jump section ... maybe.  Honestly, someone needs to map that place.  It's also a place where some swamp walks could be a huuuuuuuuuuge benefit.  Anybody looking to develop a trail, check out Fox Park!","From I-93 North or South, take exit 25 and turn right.  Once you hit the traffic circle, take the third exit and drive through town.  The road will fork right after the post office, and so you want to continue right.  Watch out for college students and pedestrians!  Go up the hill, past the bank, and take a left at the blinking yellow light onto Langdon St.  Continue through a four-way stop, and you want to take a right following the funeral home.  The Fox Park parking lot is on your left.  There are a few entrances to the trail, but the best way I think is to ride your bike past the playground and pavilion.  Should be one trailhead that starts there.",Plymouth,New Hampshire,United States,43.75234,-71.69273,Advanced,,3.0,https://images.singletracks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Fox-Park-0-orig.jpg
284906,Gyro,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/gyro/,2.0,"Alright, so the first trail on the right leads to this small dirt bowl with some smaller jumps (big enough for me) where you can have some fun.  In the middle of the bowl, if you take a left, you'll hit some of the fastest single track in the Gyro, which has wider turns, is mostly flat, and with some nice dips here and there.  Also a  long 2 x 4 that clears a gap you can skip if you're not comfortable with it.  Follow the track and it will come out close to the river (this is also where one of the other trails connects, so be on the lookout for other bikers).  Take the track along the lake and continue on (you'll see some smaller dirt jumps), ride over the see-saw, and you'll be out of the system and amidst some small houses.  You're back out on the road.  Take a right, and you can go back to the gas station.<br />
<br />
The second trailhead on the right begins the twistier single track where you'll have to watch your handlebars and weasel through some tighter spots.  This track is the longest, goes all over the place, comes out close to the river, but then turns back into the woods.  The trail will pass through a clearing and end up where that first trail comes out.  You can either continue on toward the river and finish out on the road, or you can turn on the faster single track and end your trip with the dirt bowl and come back out on the dirt service road. The trail on the left is not very twisty, it's quite short (fun too), and will pass by an impressive BMX/DJ section, before coming out in the parking lot of the first gas station you had earlier passed.  Try to turn it all into a big loop! <br />
<br />
Optional: If you want, keep taking that dirt service road back, go over an old bridge with holes in it, and into a field.  Best in the springtime when the grass is lower, but still very Little House on the Prairie any time of year.  If you see ATV/bike tracks, follow them and watch out for animal dwellings.  This leads (hopefully) to gravel road that you climb to a paved road.  Take a left, go down the road, take another left onto the next road (175), and ride back into Plymouth.  ","This one's super easy.  On I-93, North or South, take exit 25 and turn right.  You'll pass by two gas stations on your left.  Across from the second gas station is the road that leads to Plymouth State's gym parking lot, in which there is a guest section (no overnight parking).  Get on your bike, get back to the main road, and cross over to the gas station.  Take a left, see the service road between the two gas stations, and get on it.  Keep on going and you'll see a trail on the right ... then a trail on the left, then another trail on the right.

Starting at the parking lot follow a short trail into the woods and then you can turn left or right. I suggest taking a left onto Bear Claw, ride it to Hard Hat. That gets you to an access road which will run under power lines for a while. Don't miss the left onto ""The Dude Abides"". That's an awesome trail with lots of rocky sections, some natural and some man made. <br />
After the Dude decent via Spring which can be quite a bit muddy as I found out. <br />
When you get back to the power lines take a right (the left won't get you very far) and keep riding this access road to Hydra. The access road is a fast ride over exposed rock. Hydra will be your trail back to Bear Claw and the parking lot. It's easy to miss so keep your eyes open.
